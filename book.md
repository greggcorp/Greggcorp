*Research Practice* is the book that every HCI, UX, and interaction design student will read to understand what applied user research really looks like, based on the stories and experiences of the people who work in this field. _In the works now, and coming in early 2020._

### What’s the structure for this book?

The book is comprised of the following sections, with invited contributors writing short essays related to one or more sections:
* Who practices user research?
* What is the territory of user research?
* How do user researchers integrate with their organizations?
* What is the day-to-day of user research practice?
* How do you build awareness of user research in your organization?
* How do you scale your user research practice?
* What’s hard about user research?
* What happens after user research?

### How does this book differ from other UX and research books and resources?

While other books successfully cover the broad terrain of user research and common methods, there is not a book that adequately captures the day-to-day of the practice of user research for product organizations. From how to get started to scaling a team to working with designers to making tradeoffs thoughtfully, this book comprises the spectrum of user research practice experiences.

### Who is the audience for this book?

* Primary audience: UX, HCI, and interaction design students
* Secondary audience: People who already do user research on a product team
* Tertiary audiences: People who are generally interested in UX research, like product managers and designers; and career switchers, like those interested in transitioning from academia to practice
