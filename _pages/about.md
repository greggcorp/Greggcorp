## The normal bio that sounds like a human wrote it
Hi! I am a user experience research leader and the author of [*Research Practice: Perspectives from UX researchers in a changing field*](http://researchpractice.co). I am committed to user-centered product development, and I speak about my work at conferences, in classrooms, and at company events. [See where I'm speaking next](../speaking).

I am the director of user research for [Hearst Magazines](https://www.hearst.com/magazines), where I connect the worlds of content creation and consumption. Previously I managed innovative research practices at [Condé Nast](https://www.condenast.com/), [Vox Media](https://voxmedia.com), and [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com). I also taught design, branding, and typography at Georgia State University. In a previous life, I created album covers for punk and emo bands, and designed for clients in the music and advertising industries. [Visit the archive](../albums).

I studied journalism at the University of Georgia and earned my MFA in graphic design from the Savannah College of Art & Design, where I focused on [user experience research and design](../mfa). I live with my family in Athens, Georgia, where you'll often find me on solo trail runs through the forests of the state botanical gardens.
