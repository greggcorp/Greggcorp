I"G<p>For Optimal Workshop’s ebook <em>How to conduct great user interviews</em> I contributed a chapter on reading the wider environment around your research focus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sights and sounds you capture add color, depth, and detail to your interview, which can be used to e ectively design and market the right products to the right audience. It’s a practice that top companies like <a href="http://fortune.com/ikea-world-domination/">Ikea</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3040223/when-it-clicks-it-clicks">Lego</a> perform to great success; both companies have incorporated home visits and observations into their respective research arsenals to refine their product lines and how they display said products.</p>

  <p>By observing and documenting everything, you’re able to flesh out the interview with all-important details that ground your findings in context.</p>
