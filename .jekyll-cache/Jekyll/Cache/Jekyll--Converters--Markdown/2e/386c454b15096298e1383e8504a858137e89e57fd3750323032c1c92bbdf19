I"’<p>I spend a lot of my days interviewing people. Or rather, listening to peopleâ€”coworkers, customers, and professional colleagues.</p>

<p>Most of these conversations stem from a research project, or a desire to improve my research skills. Regardless, I approach my interviews with the mindset that <strong>everything is important, until proven otherwise.</strong> I believe this mantra makes me a better researcher, and provides me with better research findings. Hereâ€™s why:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If everything is important, I donâ€™t want to miss a thing</strong>. I stay on my toes, enthralled by every single thing Iâ€™m hearing. If itâ€™s important enough that someone is sharing it with me, itâ€™s important enough to receive my undivided, enthusiastic attention.</li>
  <li><strong>If everything is important, Iâ€™m disinclined to steer the conversation in a selfish direction</strong>. Thatâ€™s not to say I throw my own interview goals out the window, but I favor the direction set forth by my participant.</li>
  <li><strong>If everything is important, the conversation holds meaning for us both</strong>. My participant has a partner in me who can listen, reflect, validate, and elicit further thoughts. I get to learn something, and exit the conversation more insightful than I entered.</li>
</ul>

<p>This mindset scales beyond conversations. A couple of years ago I described how I apply it to all sorts of dataâ€”like support emails and analyticsâ€”in <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?awesome=no&amp;u=7e093c5cf4&amp;id=361d158320">Radicalizing Data</a>. Simon Ouderkirk of WordPress <a href="https://www.helpscout.net/blog/using-support-data-you-have/">shares a similar philosophy</a> of â€œassuming best intentâ€ and maintaining â€œoptimistic curiosityâ€ in his wonderful post for Help Scout.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By embracing optimism, we invest in the belief that whatâ€™s in front of us holds meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Itâ€™s too easy to become calcified, to assume that weâ€™ve heard it all before, to judge rather than journal. The best case scenario to assuming importance is that we gain wisdom and empathy. There is no worst case scenario.</p>
