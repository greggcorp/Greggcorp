I"ù<p>My friend <a href="http://www.studiodradiodurans.com/">Jan Chipchase</a> is an authority on qualitative product research. He embeds himself in the field with a team of colleagues and fixers, capturing the context and ecosystems in which people live. He‚Äôs the type of researcher I want to be when I grow up‚Äîtraveling to the far corners of the earth to uncover hidden truths and potential opportunities.</p>

<p>Jan‚Äôs taken his experiences and created the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/janchipchase/the-field-study-handbook">Field Study Handbook</a>. It was a career highlight to work with Jan as a technical reviewer on a few chapters of the handbook, and I‚Äôm excited for the book‚Äôs release in June, 2017.</p>

<p>As we get closer to the book‚Äôs launch, I contributed a short piece about what you learn about a product research team in the field.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The field, though, is opportunity. Exiting the office and entering the field introduces novelty, variety, and a chance for adaptation.</p>
