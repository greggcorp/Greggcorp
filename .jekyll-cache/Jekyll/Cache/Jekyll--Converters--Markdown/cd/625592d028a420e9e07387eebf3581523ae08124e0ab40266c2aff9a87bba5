<blockquote>
  <p>People are creatures of habit â€” your colleagues included. To make research visible and accessible, keep as much of the research process within their current technological ecosystem. Whether your org uses Slack and Google Drive, or Basecamp and Zoom, there you go: thatâ€™s your research toolbox. After six months to a year like this, youâ€™ll know whatâ€™s working just fine and whatâ€™s ripe for better tooling.</p>
