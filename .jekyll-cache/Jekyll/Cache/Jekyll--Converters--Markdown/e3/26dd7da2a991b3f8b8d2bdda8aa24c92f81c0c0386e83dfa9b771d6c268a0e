  <p>While other research books offer standard operating procedures, this book provides something more durable in the real world. Itâ€™s a practical field guide that will give you the encouragement to get started, no matter what your background.</p>

<p>This book is not an argument for doing user research. Nor is it a tutorial or toolkit for common methodologies. It wonâ€™t show you how to run a usability session or recruit users remotely.</p>

<p><strong>Research Practice captures the day-to-day of the practice itselfâ€”what it looks like to work with peers and stakeholders, to raise awareness of research, to make tradeoffs, and to build a larger team.</strong></p>

<p>Research Practice takes you inside the field of applied user research through the stories and experiences of the people doing the work.</p>

<h1 id="whats-in-the-book">Whatâ€™s in the book?</h1>
<p>Each chapter explores a specific theme:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Finding a way in</strong> presents the various pathways people take to this field. Youâ€™ll learn how practitioners navigated from schools, the social sciences, fine arts, and beyond to a career that satisfies and rewards a passion for understanding people.</li>
  <li><strong>Getting started in a new role</strong> demystifies why organizations hire researchers, how to assess a role, the hiring process, and how to start when you land a new job.</li>
  <li><strong>Building momentum</strong> describes the different roles and teams a user researcher might work with, how to build and navigate relationships with colleagues and stakeholders, and the best place within an organization for researchers to make an impact.</li>
  <li><strong>Sharing the work</strong> unpacks what researchers really share by exploring how practitioners build an awareness of research, teach research methodologies, andâ€”yesâ€”disseminate research findings with their teams and organizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Expanding your practice</strong> covers how to navigate growth in both influence and headcount for practitioners, from what research leadership means to how to hire a team to when to operationalize a practice.</li>
  <li><strong>Overcoming challenges</strong> exposes the hard parts that no one tells you about user research, from the loneliness of being a team of one to battling imposter syndrome to advocating for change to taking an ethical stand.</li>
  <li><strong>Where to go next</strong> charts the pathways of a research career through an examination of possible career ladders, perspectives on when itâ€™s time to leave a role, and thoughts on where a research leader goes when there isnâ€™t a clear next step.</li>
</ol>
