I"™<p>I launched my book <em><a href="http://researchpractice.co">Research Practice</a></em> in January of this year. What I expected to write was a pithy translation of a conference talk Iâ€™d presented a few times about scaling research practices. Instead I wrote, published, and distributed a rather lengthy anthology of original essays and findings about how to enter and thrive in a user research role.</p>
