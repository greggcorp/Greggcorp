I"<p>A few years ago I shared a list of <a href="../2016-11-18/resources">my go-to books and articles about user research</a>. Recently the folks at <a href="https://shepherd.com/">Shepherd</a> asked me to compile a list of my choice, and I figured a revised list of recommended books about user research was in order.</p>

<p>The books I recommend for <strong>understanding user research</strong> are listed here, but please visit <a href="https://shepherd.com/best-books/understanding-user-research">Shepherd</a> to learn <em>why</em> I value each book.</p>
