I"p<p>On the Vox Product blog, I describe how I create an <a href="https://product.voxmedia.com/2017/4/19/15309792/ambient-ux-research">ambient awareness of user and product research</a> across my product team by sharing everything, everywhere—repeatedly and redundantly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By showing my work everywhere and often, my colleagues see that research isn’t a “when we have the time” activity—it’s habitual and ongoing. Ideally, every project should bake in research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s clear to me that sharing findings in a way that makes them discoverable and teachable across an organization is the biggest challenge research teams face. Expect more thoughts on containing research in upcoming posts.</p>
