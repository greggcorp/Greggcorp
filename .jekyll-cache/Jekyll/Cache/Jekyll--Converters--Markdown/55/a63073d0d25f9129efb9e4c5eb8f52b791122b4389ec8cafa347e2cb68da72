I"<p>For the Mailchimp blog, I detail how we <a href="https://blog.mailchimp.com/new-mailchimp-user-persona-research/">used personas to develop a clear understanding</a> of and empathy for our users as we redesigned the Mailchimp app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We realize that personas aren’t representative of all Mailchimp customers; instead, we think of these personas as a snapshot in time of common users, knowing that their shelf-life is limited. In the short term, these personas were a big influence on our redesign process: we thought more about how teams collaborate and how individuals work in a multi-screen world.</p>
