I"ñ<p>A persona is a representation of a type of customer. Personas answer the question, â€œWho are we designing for?,â€ and they help to align strategy and goals to specific user groups. For UX Mastery, I share <a href="http://uxmastery.com/create-ux-personas/">how to conduct a persona analysis</a> in a short animated video.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Personas can give you real insights into your customers, which will result in you designing a much better product or service. Just remember that personas change over timeâ€”create them, learn from them, share them, and then donâ€™t forgot to revisit them and begin the process anew!</p>
