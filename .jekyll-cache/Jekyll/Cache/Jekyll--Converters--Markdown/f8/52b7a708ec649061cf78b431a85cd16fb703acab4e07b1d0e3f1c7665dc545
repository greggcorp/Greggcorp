I"Š<p>As a designer, I used to obsess over the emails I sent to clients about projects. Most contained a clear thesis statement about my design objectives. And an outline of how I planned to approach image and type. Sometimes I included a breakdown of the production schedule. Iâ€™d re-read these emails long after hitting â€˜sendâ€™ just to see what made sense and where I needed to improve.</p>
