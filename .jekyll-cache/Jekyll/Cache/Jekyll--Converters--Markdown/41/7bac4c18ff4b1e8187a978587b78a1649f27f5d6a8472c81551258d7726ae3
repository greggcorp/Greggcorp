I"<p>For <em>The Verge</em>, I wrote about Facebook’s news trustworthiness survey. While its brevity is gaining attention, the real issue with the Facebook survey is poor editing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For their paean to minimalism, I salute the team behind this survey. However, the problem here isn’t that the survey is short. Rather, the two survey questions are phrased poorly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to take a second to admit how surreal it is to open this update with “For <em>The Verge</em>.” When I was finishing grad school, <em>The Verge</em> launched. I knew immediately that it would become one of my favorite websites, and came very, very close to introducing myself via email to see what use they might have for a UX researcher or designer. That I ended up working with and contributing to <em>The Verge</em> a few short years later is a career highlight.</p>
