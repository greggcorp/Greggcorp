I"ï<p>Hiring is hard: job descriptions are tricky to write; applications take time to screen and evaluate; and interviews afford limited space to ask and answer essential questions. Even with the help of a recruiter or talent acquisition team, the hiring process is still <em>a process</em>. While I canâ€™t improve the various steps toward hiring, I can share something that makes application screening a little less tedious: <strong>I ask for something specific in the cover letter</strong>.</p>
