I"ı<p><em>Iâ€™m writing a book about product research, and I update folks about it via a newsletter. In <a href="https://mailchi.mp/71670cb9b337/an-update-on-the-research-practice-book">a recent issue</a>, I shared some of my process, as well as my plans for development and publication of the book. A number of folks got in touch to tell me they enjoyed learning about my specific writing process, so I thought Iâ€™d post it here. To get updates like this in your inbox, <a href="http://gregg.io/book/">please subscribe to my newsletter</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m an early riser. Thereâ€™s nothing better than waking way before the sunâ€”before the kids need to be packed up for school and before responsibilities take overâ€”and starting the day with a text editor and a hot cup of coffee.</p>

<p>I start writing at 5:30 each morning, and plug away until 6:50 when the kids arise. I donâ€™t always fill that time with writingâ€”sometimes I need to stare at my outline a bit and orient my current thoughts within the larger story Iâ€™m telling. Sometimes I noodle on the right word choice or the best phrase for a solid hour. But it doesnâ€™t matterâ€”itâ€™s my time and my words.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about this topic for a few years now, which has manifested as a couple of conference talks, lots of conversations with allies in the industry, a whole lot of affinity mapping, and finally as a book outline. To be honest, Iâ€™m a better outliner than mapper, and feel like affinity mapping took me too far afield. Something about a nested list of words clarifies everything for me in a way that a cluster of notes doesnâ€™t.</p>

<p>I use the Bear notes app to write, and I keep my outline in a window on the left half of my screen, with my current chapter in a separate window on the right. If I keep the outline visible at all times, it both keeps me on track and reassures me when I have moments of â€œWTF are you even doing, Bernstein?â€</p>

<em>The book outline (l) and a chapter-in-progress (r)</em></p>

<p>I start a new note for each chapter, and Iâ€™m writing everything in markdown. When I write something but I think it needs more rigor, I highlight the text to remind myself to revisit it. When I stop writing each morning, I add a comment at my last passage that simply says, â€œStopping point.â€ I do this because from time to time I end up writing out of sequence, so picking up where I left off is not as simple as scrolling to the end of a note.</p>

<h2 id="the-writing-plan">The writing plan</h2>
<p>A long time ago, I asked <a href="https://www.nicolefenton.com/">Nicole Fenton</a>, editor extraordinaire, to work with me as I develop this book. (Since then, Nicole joined me as a colleague at <a href="http://voxmedia.com/">Vox Media</a>, whichâ€¦ more Nicole Fenton is a good thing. I highly recommend it.) Sheâ€™s been my sounding board as I articulate my thoughts and explore content directions. Iâ€™m nearly at a stopping point for the first half of the book, at which point Iâ€™ll pause to reexamine the content with Nicole and make edits based on her suggestions.</p>

<p>Then Iâ€™m going to follow the advice <a href="https://jakeknapp.com/">Jake Knapp</a>, author of /Make Time/ and /Sprint/, offered to me: open source the process. Iâ€™m going to share an excerpt and the chapter descriptions with this mailing list in a Google Doc, and then ask for your feedback in a survey. Your input will help me shore up any gaps and clarify anything thatâ€™s unclear.</p>

<p>My favorite UX book of the past few years is Abby Covertâ€™s <a href="http://abbytheia.com/makesense/">How to Make Sense of Any Mess</a> (also edited by Nicole Fenton). She published it herself. My favorite research book of the past few years is Jan Chipchaseâ€™s <a href="https://www.thefieldstudyhandbook.com/">Field Study Handbook</a>. He published it himself.</p>

<p>Research Practice is a labor of love. Itâ€™s a book of takeaways from my experiences, and Iâ€™m doing it on my terms. I am confident in the content and its presentation, and I plan to publish this book myself. Thanks to <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/self-publishing-a-book-for-fun-and-profit/">Brad Frost</a> and <a href="http://abbytheia.com/2014/11/06/how-i-made-sense-of-my-mess/">Abby Covertâ€™s</a> detailed documentation of going through this process themselves, I have a model to follow.</p>
