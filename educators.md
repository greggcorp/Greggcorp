## For educators

You can order *Research Practice* from most mainstream, independent, and academic bookstores. Ask for ISBN 9780578811178.

If you are a university or bootcamp instructor and wonder if *Research Practice* might make a nice addition to your curriculum (it would!), please get in touch for a free digital review copy (or free print edition within the United States).

If your class adopts *Research Practice,* Gregg will happily join for a virtual discussion with your students.
