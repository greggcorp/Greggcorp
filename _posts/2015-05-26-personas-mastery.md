A persona is a representation of a type of customer. Personas answer the question, “Who are we designing for?,” and they help to align strategy and goals to specific user groups. For UX Mastery, I share [how to conduct a persona analysis](https://uxmastery.com/create-ux-personas/) in a short animated video.

>Personas can give you real insights into your customers, which will result in you designing a much better product or service. Just remember that personas change over time—create them, learn from them, share them, and then don’t forgot to revisit them and begin the process anew!
