description: I created a list of the best books for understanding ux research for Shepherd
tags: [Book, Resources]

A few years ago I shared a list of [my go-to books and articles about user research](../resources). Recently the folks at [Shepherd](https://shepherd.com/) asked me to compile a list of my choice, and I figured a revised list of recommended books about user research was in order.

The books I recommend for **understanding user research** are listed here, but please visit [Shepherd](https://shepherd.com/best-books/understanding-user-research) to learn *why* I value each book.
* [Just Enough Research](http://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research) by Erika Hall
* [Interviewing Users](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/) by Steve Portigal
* [The Field Study Handbook](https://www.thefieldstudyhandbook.com/) by Jan Chipchase
* [The Moment of Clarity](https://www.redassociates.com/the-moment-of-clarity-1) by Christian Madsbjerg and Mikkel B. Rasmussen
* [How to Make Sense of Any Mess](http://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/) by Abby Covert
