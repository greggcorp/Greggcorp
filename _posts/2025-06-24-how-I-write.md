## A brief reintroduction

I tend to write concisely.* If I can get an idea across with an economy of words, why belabor my point? I edit as I write, rephrasing and cutting until what’s left is my point and little more.

A [mentor](http://aworkinglibrary.com/) once told me to think about the point I’m trying to get across, and determine whether it’s a talk, a blog post, or a tweet. What begins as a grand exposition shrinks to a blog post before reducing, like a stock, to nothing more than a sentence-length post shared on social media. Cut until there’s nothing left to cut.

This works for me. It doesn’t always work when I edit others. When writing is a rare activity, every word feels precious. But when you edit in real time, all the time — whether on the page or in conversation — no words are spared. “I’ve never been edited like this,” a self-described thought leader once complained to me when I returned my notes on his book’s introduction. His ideas had also never been clearly understood.

My love of writing is also a love for writers, and how I write differs from what I read. Charles Dickens, [Emily St. John Mandel](https://bookshop.org/beta-search?keywords=Emily+St+John+Mandel), [Joe Posnanski](https://www.joeposnanski.com/), and [Dan Sinker](https://dansinker.com/) have little in common in writing style (and have likely never appeared together in the same sentence). Each has instructed me. Exposure to many voices — and many more ideas — tells me not just what ideas would be worth sharing, but how I might express them. It took time and practice to land on what works for me, but it starts with exposure to other writers.

I’ve been fortunate to work as a researcher in media and publishing since 2012, and I am even more fortunate to learn from writers and readers in my current role as staff researcher at [Medium](http://medium.com/). I plan to write about my work at Medium on Medium going forward, while also cross-posting to my blog. I’ll do so as briefly as possible.

*I considered revising this sentence to read, “I write concisely,” but decided against such a declaration. “I tend” signals that concision is a goal, not a rule.
