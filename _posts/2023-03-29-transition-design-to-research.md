Over on Learners, I answered the question, “What’s your advice for designers transitioning into a research role?”

I was a designer and design professor before I transitioned into UX research. While there is *plenty* to learn to successfully make the transition from design to research, one thing that worked for me was to **think of every facet of the research process as a discrete experience to design**. Here’s how you might do this:

* In creating a research plan, your goal is to design the combination of methods and participants that will yield the right knowledge.
* In writing a discussion guide, you can design, test, and finalize a question flow that will yield informative answers.
* In planning a usability test, you have to design the right mix of tasks and questions to yield conclusive findings.
* You can design how your colleagues will *experience* your research; what will your workshops, research updates, or presentations be like?

To be sure, each one of the tasks I mentioned above is a lot to think about. But by breaking the research process into a series of smaller experiences to design for our participants and colleagues, we're able to leverage our design training in service of our research goals.

So in short: think of your research process as yet another experience to design.
