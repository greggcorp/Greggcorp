I've collected a number of research-related bookmarks over the years. However, I often struggle to find the specifc links I need at the exact moment I need them. 

To solve for this, I created a Notion database of the resources I’ve found useful in my work. And I've made it public.

[Research Practice &#124; Bookmarks](https://greggcorp.notion.site/Research-Practice-Bookmarks-6e6ffb6c8cc0484b8dc4b0485e584afd?pvs=4)

Please note that my collection is not exhaustive—there are other great resources out there! Nor is every bookmark something I absolutely agree with. I tend not to bookmark generic guides or overviews (like those published by software companies), as these resources are abundant and easy enough to find in the wild.

If you have a trusted resource you think is missing from the collection, you'll also find a linked form to suggest additions.

Happy learning!
