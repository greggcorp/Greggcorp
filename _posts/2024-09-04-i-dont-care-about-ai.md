## I don't care about AI, because AI is neither the product nor the solution.

I don’t care about AI. I don’t care that your product has it. I don’t care that you think we’re on the cusp of some huge developments—that the real AI breakthrough is just around the corner. 

I’ll go further: *I don't think most people care about AI*, because “AI” is not a thing to care about. AI is a broad term that covers a whole lot of territory, akin to how a previous generation sweatily appended the terms “net” and “cyber” to everything to signal alignment with a vague conception of "the internet." Nothing furrows my brow and sets off my BS detector faster than seeing “AI-assisted” slapped onto your product’s marketing messaging, because that tells me you're more focused on a buzzword rather than a tangible benefit.

AI is a catchall term that describes a thing in service of another thing. It’s neither the product nor the goal. It's like selling people on the capabilities of plumbing and paper manufacturing when *they just want to make a bathroom stop during a road trip after a poorly-planned Taco Bell menu decision*. It overlooks the **goals** (functional restroom, stocked with toilet paper) and **desired outcomes** (gastrointestinal relief, resumption of travel) in favor of the infrastructure.

I don’t care about AI, but I do care about people:<br> 
I care about their problems and how to help them solve them.<br>
I care about their challenges and how to overcome them.<br>
I care about their habits and how to support or change them.<br>
**I care about human-centered goals and how to reach them.** 

If the best way to help people includes AI, great! If not, also great. AI is one potential ingredient in service of a greater, more meaningful thing. The place of AI is in the middle ground between people and their goals. Focus on the humans.

*PS. My first draft of this post was an homage to Mazieres and Kohler’s brilliant academic paper, “[Get me off Your Fucking Mailing List](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/home/papers/remove.pdf).” It went something like this:*<br>
I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI. I don’t care about AI.<br>
