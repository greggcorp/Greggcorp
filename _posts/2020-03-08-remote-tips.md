When the spread of Covid-19 introduced many folks to remote research, I quickly compiled and shared a few of the practices and tips that have worked for me as a remote researcher and research director.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve conducted research and managed research teams remotely for years. It takes discipline, intentionality, and  thoughtfulness. With recent events introducing many folks to remote research, I thought I&#39;d share the practices that work for me, my teams, and my orgs. YMMV.</p>&mdash; Gregg Bernstein (@greggcorp) <a href="https://twitter.com/greggcorp/status/1236754370273980419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

I've given that thread of practices that work for me, my teams, and my orgs a proper home here.

* For your team, establish a place for updates, collaboration, and gut-checks. This could be Slack, a group SMS, a running Google Doc, Miro, etc.
* Also for your team, designate an accessible source of truth for the work and the responsible parties. This could be a spreadsheet, Jira, Trello, etc.
* Remote doesn't mean working in a vacuum. Keep your standups and 1-1s, but use a Hangout or a phone call to remain tethered.
* Remain tethered to your org as well. Use the established communication channels of your org to share updates. If this is email for your org, spin up a research updates newsletter. If your org uses Slack, establish a dedicated research Slack channel.
* No lie: running interviews and usability tests from afar takes *extra* energy. Participants need explicit directions on how to join using the tech platform you use. You'll need to be overly emotive to build rapport from afar.
* You'll need to think about how you'll manage releases, consent, and incentives with remote participants. This might require a conversation with your legal team about consent and releases, and your finance team about sending payments.
* When you're remote, it takes significant effort to include other teams in research sessions. Use those Slack channels or email newsletters. Put events on group calendars. Be like  Kool-Aid man and bust into other teams' channels to keep everyone connected.
* Be just as intentional in communicating *after* every interview or test: share ad hoc updates however you can. Make sure everyone knows research is still happening, albeit differently than in the past.
* Build new habits. Monthly virtual brown bags. Weekly research lunch-and-learns. Whatever it takes to foster connectedness, try it out. Not every remote research experiment will be a success, but you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
